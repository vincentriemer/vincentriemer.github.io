title: Blog Launch!
description: Call all your friends, put on your nicest t-shirt, and break out the Andre; this blog is officially live!

I consider this launch a bit more meaningful than just the unveiling of some HTML and CSS displayed prettily by your browser of choice. This blog marks the beginning of my first full-time job search, and seeing as I'm going to be looking for a web development job, it seemed like a good idea to have a nice blog to showcase some of my front-end skills.

The blog itself is running using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), and standard HTML. The only JavaScript library that is running right now on the site is [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) and while I'm not currently doing any feature checking, the first task to work on is to make this blog more cross-browser compatible. I do not anticipate there to be many problems currently (as the site is fairly basic) but I am using some CSS3 and HTML5 features that could break if somebody visited the site with an outdated browser.

For the design of the blog, I focused on readability more than flair. It is immediately apparent that I took a lot of inspiration from [Medium](http://medium.com/) in the typography department and there's good reason for that. The team at Medium has done a lot of research when it comes to its typography and readability and while I do a good amount of design work on my own, I really could not compete with the readability of their site. 

I am however using a slightly different font choice in trying to keep the text as legible as in Medium while making the text look less like it came from a book. For the header text I went with [Aktiv Grotesk Std by Dalton Maag](https://typekit.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk-std) because I liked how it seemed to provide a familiar sans-serif feel to something like Helvetica but added just the smallest amount of character (without becoming something like Avenir). 

For the body text I went with [Rooney Web by Jan Fromm](https://typekit.com/fonts/rooney-web). This selection came about from a lot of A/B testing with various other serif fonts hosted by Typekit that I liked and Rooney provided the best balance between readability and style in the collection of possible fonts I had to choose from.

I think that this is a great backbone for a good-looking blog and I am looking forward to start extending it further with maybe ajax support or some neat uses of imagery and sound. I am not sure what sorts of topics I will exactly be discussing in the future. I could be making technical posts about some sort of software development I am working on or posts about audio production and sound design. Either way this blog will act as a sort of insight into how I think and what I am working on. I am looking forward to adding some neat content in the future and experimenting with all the growing web technologies.
